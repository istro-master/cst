# Contents Shopper Token

SmartCotract project for CST (Contents Shopper Token) ERC-20 token.

An intellectual property management and trading platform that can be used worldwide with a single disclosure

Contents Shopper is the name of a platform that makes it easy for anyone to manage and sell their intellectual property rights, and CST means the utility token used on this platform.
The goal of Contents Shopper is to disclose and NFTize everything that is subject to intellectual property rights, such as not only works of art, but also music, novels, poetry, ideas, and know-how through the disclosure function of the blockchain, which cannot be forged or altered, so that anyone can easily manage and trade their intellectual property rights. 
Since the blockchain is an information system that can be inquired from anywhere in the world, there is no need to register or manage intellectual property rights in each country, and since NFTized intellectual property rights are not affected by the national policy of each country and transferred on the blockchain without additional documentation, which enables transfers, so this makes it easier to manage and trade than existing intellectual property rights.
In particular, through the Contents Shopper, it becomes possible to disclose creations made through artificial intelligence that were not protected because of the blind spot in the existing intellectual property rights. This will serve as a window to protect the rights of creations using artificial intelligence, which is on a rise.
